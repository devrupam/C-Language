Collection of programming examples and exercises from the Stroustrup classic on C++ programming.

Some useful links:

* [C++ Programming Language, AT&T Bell Labs](http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html)
* [C++ Guru of the Week Archive](http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/)

Only including examples from those sections of the book that I thought were interesting enough to warrant it:

**Chapter 2 - A Tour of C++**
* Section 2.4 - Modular Programming
* Section 2.5 - Data Abstractions
* Section 2.6 - Object-Oriented Programming
* Section 2.7 - Generic Programming
