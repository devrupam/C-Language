Exercise 2 - Obenglobish
------------------------ 

Most people - at least those in English-speaking countries - have played the Pig Latin game at some point in their lives. There are, however, other invented "languages" in which words are created using some simple transformation of English. One such language is called *Obenglobish* in which words are created by adding the letters *ob* before the vowels (*a*, *e*, *i*, *o* and *u*) in an English word. For example, under this rule, the word *english* gets the letters *ob* added before *e* and the *i* to form *obenglobish*, which is how the language gets its name.
