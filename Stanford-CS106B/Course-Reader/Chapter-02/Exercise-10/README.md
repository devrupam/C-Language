Exercise 10
-----------

The *C(n,k)* function from the text and the *P(n,k)* function from the preceding exercise come up often in computational mathematics, particularly in an area called *combinatorics*, which is concerned with counting the ways objects can be combined. Now that you have C++ implementations for each of these functions, it might be worth putting them in a library so that you can use them in many different applications.

Write the files **combinatorics.h** and **combinatorics.cpp** for a library that exports the functions **permutations** and **combinations**. When you write the implementation, make sure to rewrite the code for the **combinations** function so that it uses the efficiency enhancements suggested for permutations in exercise 9.
