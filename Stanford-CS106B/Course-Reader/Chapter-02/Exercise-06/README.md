Exercise 06
----------- 

An integer greater than 1 is said to be *prime* if it has no divisors other than itself and one. The number 17, for example, is prime, because there are no numbers other than 1 and 17 that divide evenly into it. The number 91, however, is not prime because it is divisible by 7 and 13. Write a predicate method **isPrime(n)** that returns **true** if the integer *n* is prime, and **false** otherwise. To test your algorithm, write a main program that lists the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

Note: The primes less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
