Exercise 13
----------- 

*I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.* 
- Albert Einstein, 1947

Despite Einstein's metaphysical objections, the current models of physics, and particularly of quantum theory, are based on the idea that nature does indeed involve random processes. A radioactive atom, for example, does not decay for any specific reason that we mortals understand. Instead, that atoms has a random probability of decaying within a period of time. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't and there is no way to know for sure.
