Exercise 2
---------- 

Reimplement the distance-conversion program from exercise 2 in Chapter 1 so that it uses a function. In this case, the function must produce both the number of feet and the number of inches, which means that you need to use call by reference to return these values.

Note: This program requires linking with the Stanford C++ Libraries:
