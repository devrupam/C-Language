Exercise 8
---------- 

*Books were bks and Robin Hood was Rbinhd. Little Goody Two
Shoes lost her Os and so did Goldilocks, and the former became a
whisper, and the latter sounded like a key jiggled in a lck. It was 
impossible to read "cockadoodledoo" aloud, and parents gave up 
reading to their children, and some gav eup reading altogether.*
