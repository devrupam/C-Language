Exercise 7
---------- 

Write a function

<pre>
string removeCharacters(string str, string remove);
</pre>

that returns a new string consisting of the characters in **str** after removing all instances of the characters in **remove**. For example, if you call

<pre>

</pre>

the function should return "**cntrrvltnrs**", which is the original string after removing all of its vowels.
