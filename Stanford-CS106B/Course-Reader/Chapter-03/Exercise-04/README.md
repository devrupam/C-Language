Exercise 4
---------- 

Implement a function **capitalize(str)** that returns a string in which the initial character is capitalized (if it is a letter) and all other letters are converted to lowercase. Characters other than letters are not affected. For example, both **capitalize("BOOLEAN")** and **capitalize("boolean")** should return the string "Boolean".
