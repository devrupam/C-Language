Exercise 6
---------- 

An *acronym* is a new word formed by combining, in order, the initial letters of a series of words. For example, the word *scuba* is an acronym formed from the first letters in *self-contained underwater breathing apparatus*. Similarly, *AIDS* is an acronym for *Acquired Immune Deficieny Syndrome*. Write a function **acronym** that takes a string and returns the acronym formed from that string. To ensure that your function treats hyphenated compounds like *self-contained* as two words, it should define the beginning of a word as any alphabetic character that appears either at the beginning of the string or after a non-alphabetic character.
