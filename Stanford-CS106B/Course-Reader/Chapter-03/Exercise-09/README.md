Exercise 9
---------- 

*The waste of time in spelling imaginary sounds and their history
(or etymology as it is called) is monstrous in English...*

- George Bernard Shaw, 1941

In the early part of the 20th century, there was considerable interest in both England and the United States in simplifying the rules for spelling English words, which has always been a difficult proposition. One suggestion advanced as part of this movement was to eliminate all doubled letters, so that *bookkeeper* would be written as *bokeper* and *committee* would become *comite*. Write a function **removeDoubledLetters(str)* that returns a new string in which any duplicated characters in *str* have been replaced by a single copy.
