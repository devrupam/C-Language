*There is no gene for the human spirit.*

The genetic code for all living organisms is carried in its DNA - a molecule with the remarkable capacity to replicate its own structure. The DNA molecule itself consists of a long strand of chemical bases wound together with a similar strand in a double helix. DNA's ability to replicate comes from the fact that its four constiuent bases - adenosine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine - combine with each other only in the following ways:

* Cytosine on one strand links only with the guanine on the other, and vice versa.
* Adenosine links only with thymine, and vice versa.

Biologists abbreviate the names of the bases by writing only the initial letter: **A**, **C**, **G** or **T**.

Inside the cell, a DNA strand acts as a template to which other DNA strands can attach themselves. As an example, suppose that you have the following DNA strand, in which the position of each base has been numbered as it would be in a C++ string:

<pre>
T A A C G G T A C G T  C
------------------------- 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
</pre>
