The German mathematican Leibniz (1646-1716) discovered the rather remarkable fact that the mathematical constant pi can be computed using the following mathematical relationship:

<pre>
pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...
</pre>

The formula to the right of the equal sign represents an infinite series; each fraction represents a term in that series. If you start with 1, subtract one-third, add one-fifth, and so on, for each of the odd integers, you get a number that gets closer and closer to the value of pi/4 as you go along.

Write a program that calculates an approximation of pi consisting of the first 10,000 terms in Leibnitz's series.
