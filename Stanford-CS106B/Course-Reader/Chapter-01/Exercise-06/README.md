Exercise 6
---------- 

For a slightly more interesting challenge, write a program that finds both the largest and second-largest number in a list, prior to the entry of a sentinel. Once again, using 0 as the sentinel, a sample run of this program might look like this:

<pre>
This program finds the largest integer in a list.
Enter 0 to signal the end of the list.
 ? 223
 ? 251
 ? 317
 ? 636
 ? 766
 ? 607
 ? 607
 ? 0
The largest value was 766.
The second largest value was 636.
</pre>

The values in this sample run are the number of pages in the British hardcover editions of J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. The output therefore tells us that the longest book (*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*) has 766 pages and the second-longest book (*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*) weighs in at a mere 636 pages.
