Exercise 7
---------- 

Using the **AddIntegerList** program from Figure1-5 as a model, write a program **AverageList** that reads in a list of integers representing exam scores and then prints out the average. Because some unprepared student might actually get a score of 0, your program should use -1 as the sentinel to mark the end of the input.
