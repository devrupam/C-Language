Exercise 9
---------- 

Every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. This factorization is unique and is called the **prime factorization**. For example, the number 60 can be decomposed into the factors 2 x 2 x 3 x 5, each of which is prime. Note that the same prime can appear more than once in the factorization.

Write a program to display the prime factorization of a number *n*, as illustrated by the following sample run:

<pre>
This program factors a number.
