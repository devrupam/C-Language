Exercise 5
---------- 

Write a program that reads in a list of integers from the user until the user enters the value 0 as a sentinel. When the sentinel appears, your program should display the largest value in the list, as illustrated in the following sample run:

<pre>
This program finds the largest integer in a list.
Enter 0 to signal the end of the list.
 ? 17
 ? 42
 ? 11 
 ? 19
 ? 35
 ? 0
The largest value was 42.
