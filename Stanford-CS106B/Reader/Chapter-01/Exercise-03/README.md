Exercise 3
---------- 

As mathematical historians have told the story, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) began to show his mathematical talent at a very early age. When he was in elementary school, Gauss was asked by his teacher to compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and 100. Gauss is said to have given the answer instantly: 5050. Write a program that computes the answer to the question Gauss' teacher posed.
